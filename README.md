Background:

    Ben Hogan, one of the greatest professional golfers of all time, once said "The most important shot in golf is the next one." Building upon that mindset, I bring you: Putt Putt Park. Putt Putt Park is a mini golf game where a player's goal is to get the ball into the hole(target). 

    The ball will be placed from the starting point, then the player is able to control the direction of the ball (360 degrees) and then the velocity of the ball. Since the goal is to get the ball as few tries as possible, a player is to utilize the layout of each "green" and incorprate the advantages and disadvantages of the course.

Functionality & MVPs:

    With Putt Putt Park, users will be able to:
        - Start and reset the game board
        - Add player info
        - Keep track of score
        - Toggle to shoot the ball

Technologies, Libraries, APIs:
    This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
        - Canvas API to render the game board
        - Webpack and Babel to bundle and run the Javascript code
        - npm to manage project dependencies
